# Cat_and_mouse
This repository is for a cat mouse game. There are two circles that are generated on opposite ends of the screen with random directions. The left circle is the user controled cat. The left and right arrow key rotates the direction of the cat and the goal is to catch the mouse (other circle). The game ends when the cat catches the mouse. The project was created as part of an assignment for CPSC-223N at Cal State University Fullerton. Programs provided by Professor Floyd Holliday were edited and used for this project.
